            Monkeypox (or MPXV for short) is a DNA virus from the Orthopox family (Orthopoxvirus, which includes smallpסx,
            cowpox and more), so named after it was discovered in laboratory monkeys in Denmark in 1958. It was first identified in
            humans in Central and West Africa in 1970. Over the next decade, 47 cases were reported, 38 in the Congo alone. Over
            80% of those infected were children up to age 10, and only in a few cases was there human to human transmission.[1]
            Since infection rates, R, were below 1, the outbreak was self-limiting. In contrast, in the 1990s there were 419 DRC cases
            reported, only 22% of which reported no contact with another person with monkeypox, while 78% had contact with an
            infected person 7–21 days before onset of disease.[2] In the first nine months of 2020 alone, 4,594 suspected cases were
            reported in the DRC.[3] From January 2020 to May 2022 an estimated 10,545 suspected cases of monkeypox occured in
            the Congo, of which 362 died.[4] In 2017, Nigeria reported their first outbreak of monkeypox after almost 40 years, of
            the 181 confirmed cases 9 died. From this outbreak, cases were identified in travelers to the UK, Israel, and Singapore.[5]
            Additional infected travelers were reported in Israel in 2018, three in the UK (two in 2018 infecting an additional
            infected individual there; one in 2019). As with other epidemics, actual cases are likely higher. From May until mid June
            2003, imported African rodents caused a US outbreak with 71 reported cases, most of which were directly exposed to
            the rodents.[6]

            Monkeypox is similar enough to smallpox that the smallpox vaccine is about 85% effective against monkeypox.[7]
            Smallpox was eradicated worldwide in 1980, and the associated vaccination campaign ended with the exception of
            soldiers in some countries. The vaccine's effectiveness fades among vaccinated people and since the 1970s. Several
            generations around the world have not been routinely vaccinated.

            <p className="my-2">
            At the time, it was estimated that monkeypox was not contagious enough to justify continued immunization of
            smallpox vaccines and this perspective has lasted for several decades.[8] By 2010, there was a 20 fold increase in
            monkeypox cases in the Congo, as compared to the 1980s at the end of smallpox vaccination. Unvaccinated individuals
            were 5 times more likely to be infected than vaccinated individuals.[9]

            The virus is likely to mutate over time. In this case, it appears to have resulted in changes in the demographics of those
            who are infected. In the 1970s, mainly young children were infected, while recently mainly young adults are infected.
            The monkeypox virus has two main variants (called clades), a Central African variant that is more lethal with around 11%
            mortality and a West African with 3.6% mortality.[5] The one that is currently spreading globally is the West African
            variant. If the quality of medical care is a significant factor, death rates in the developed world may be lower, but longer
            term impacts may also be a common outcome.
            </p>
            <p className="my-2">
            Ongoing outbreaks, even if limited, create an opportunity for mutated viruses to arise with distinct properties.[10]
            Currently conflicting reports indicate either few changes or significant changes in the monkeypox virus in recent years.

            The 2022 global monkeypox outbreak, which includes countries in Africa as well as many countries in Europe, North
            America, Australia and elsewhere is the first of its kind for monkeypox, and involves significant community transmission.
            This is apparent because many cases are not associated with travelers to Africa or animal contact.[13]

            Many of those infected outside Africa in the first two weeks of May 2022 are men who have sex with other men. Since
            past outbreaks have affected all ages and sexes, a plausible explanation, for which evidence is accumulating, is that the
            rapid spread of this outbreak is the result of a superspreading event or events and global connectivity of this
            community. A possible candidate event is the Pride Parade of the Canary Islands, which took place in early May 2022
            and was attended by an estimated 80,000 LGBT people from all over the world. Local outbreaks in Europe involving men
            who have sex with men have been linked to travelers from this event.[14] However, this does not account for all
            identified cases, and some cases in women have been identified.[15]

            It is advisable to (1) alert the public to be on the lookout for characteristic symptoms, especially but not exclusively in
            LGBT communities, and (2) engage in rapid contact tracing and (3) institute quarantines for close contacts of identified
            cases.
